# employeeTracker

With this application, we have built a system for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

This app allows the user to add an employee, view all employees, remove employees, update employee roles, add departments, view all departments, add roles, and view all roles.

JavaScript, MySQL, node, and inquirer used.
